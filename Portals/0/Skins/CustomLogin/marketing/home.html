      <p>That's what we've been doing since 2005 — showing clients how to remove the obstacles that stand in the way of delivering exceptional customer experiences. </p>
      <p>We know and understand the landscape. </p>
			<p>Every company has customers. Every company has an ideal customer <b>continuum</b> that looks something like this: </p>
      <img src="images/home/home-new-advocate.jpg" alt="transition from new user to advocate">
      <p>Every company would love to have a proven, repeatable path to quickly bring the right customers along that continuum and create advocates out of them.</p>
      <p>Creating a proven, repeatable path for producing advocates requires a successful strategy, properly executed at each point along the customer continuum. </p>

      <p>The challenge is, most companies have a broad range of expertise within their marketing and customer experience departments. At the expert level, corporate strategy is easily defined and understood. But infusing that strategy in ways that are meaningful and understood by everyone within the department, isn’t easy. </p>
      <p>The holistic nature of the strategy gets chipped away, little by little, as it moves back and forth along the company’s internal expertise continuum. </p>
      <img src="images/home/home-novice-expert.jpg" alt="transition from novice user to expert">
      <p>Companies who can widen the view for their teams naturally provide best-in-class customer experiences. They’re able to consistently execute the strategy that wins them advocates. </p>

      <p>We do this through our <a href="#">ClearAction Value Exchange</a> platform. The Value Exchange meets marketers wherever they are on the expertise <b>continuum</b> and delivers real-world knowledge to solve everyday problems. Knowledge is delivered in a variety of ways, from virtual Solve-Spaces (single-focused marketing exercises authored by experts and designed to educate) and secure company-centric Collaboration Spaces (“I have a clearly defined idea I think will work to fix this issue, please tell me what you think and how we can improve”), to in-person and virtual conferences, roundtables and events. In addition, members will also have access to specialized training, open forums, and subject matter content <b>curated specifically to their interests and metric goals. </b></p>
      <p>Members are guided to discovery and shown how to take advantage of the tools and knowledge that will quickly and assuredly move them across the expertise continuum. This knowledge and expertise transfer means faster results for the member, the organization and of course, your customers. </p>
