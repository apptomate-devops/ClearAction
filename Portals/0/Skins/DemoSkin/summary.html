                        Identify Needed Roles

                    <h2>Wisdom for this step:</h2>
                    <p>
                        In planning a marketing campaign it's best to clearly identify your target audience and get to know their needs before creating marketing messages. It's the same for any big change from people's routines. Use these templates for every effort that requires your stakeholders to get onboard with a new way of doing things.

                    <p>
                        Brainstorm a list of all the people (or at least all the groups/departments) who have a stake in the change. Indicate the role needed by them for the success of the change —  Let It Happen, Help It Happen, or Make It Happen.

                        Discovering your target audience's hot buttons is a key to successful messaging, both in marketing campaigns and in managing a group's transition to new habits. Understand what makes them tick and emphasize "what's in it for them" early and often.

                        In a marketing campaign, once your target audience's persona is deﬁned, you are ready to create messaging and a portfolio of integrated marketing communications. Likewise, in managing a change, you are now ready to create a playbook of messages and interactions that will (1) reduce what's not appealing and (2) increase what is appealing for each of your stakeholders.

                        To accelerate market adoption of what your company sells, you will probably want to engage early adopters in helping to spread your message. The same is true in leading a big change. Think about which other stakeholders they have an opportunity to inﬂuence. Then brainstorm ways they could be a good inﬂuence, and ways you could help them get started as an inﬂuencer.
